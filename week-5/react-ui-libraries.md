**Introduction:**
In this week's lessons, we will explore various React UI libraries and styling methods for creating beautiful and functional user interfaces. We will dive into CSS-in-JS techniques, learn about popular libraries like Styled-components and Emotion, and discuss UI libraries such as Material-UI, Ant Design, and Bootstrap.

1. **Introduction to React UI Libraries and Styling**
   - Importance of UI libraries and styling in React: UI libraries and styling tools help developers quickly build visually appealing and consistent user interfaces without having to reinvent the wheel.
   - Benefits of using CSS-in-JS: CSS-in-JS provides a more modular approach to styling, improves performance, and makes it easier to manage dynamic styles.
2. **CSS-in-JS**

   - Overview: CSS-in-JS is a styling approach that allows developers to write CSS using JavaScript syntax, which is then compiled into regular CSS.
   - Benefits: CSS-in-JS provides better code organization, improved performance, and easier handling of dynamic styles compared to traditional CSS.
   - Usage: To use CSS-in-JS, you can install and use libraries such as Styled-components or Emotion.
   - Example:

     ```

     import styled from "styled-components";

     const Button = styled.button`
       background-color: blue;
       color: white;
       font-size: 16px;
     `;

     function App() {
       return <Button>Click me</Button>;
     }

     ```

   - Exercise: Create a React component using CSS-in-JS and add some basic styles.

3. **Styled-components**

   - Overview: Styled-components is a popular CSS-in-JS library that allows you to create styled React components using tagged template literals.
   - Installation and setup: Install Styled-components using **`npm install styled-components`** or **`yarn add styled-components`**. Don't forget to import it in your component.
   - Creating styled components: Use the **`styled`** object to create new styled components with CSS properties.
   - Theming and global styles: Styled-components provides a **`ThemeProvider`** to manage theming and a **`createGlobalStyle`** function for global styles.
   - Example:

     ```
     import styled, { ThemeProvider, createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

     const GlobalStyle = createGlobalStyle`
       body {
         margin: 0;
         padding: 0;
         font-family: sans-serif;
       }
     `;

     const Button = styled.button`
       background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
       color: white;
       font-size: 16px;
     `;

     const theme = {
       primary: "blue",
     };

     function App() {
       return (
         <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
           <GlobalStyle />
           <Button>Click me</Button>
         </ThemeProvider>
       );
     }

     ```

   - Exercise: Create a styled React component using Styled-components and implement theming.

4. **Emotion**
   - Overview: Emotion is another popular CSS-in-JS library that provides a similar API to Styled-components but focuses on performance and flexibility.
   - Installation and setup: Install Emotion using **`npm install @emotion/react @emotion/styled`** or **`yarn add @emotion/react @emotion/styled`**. Import it in your component.
   - Creating styled components: Use the **`styled`** object from Emotion to create new styled components with CSS properties.
   - Theming and global styles: Emotion provides a **`ThemeProvider`** for managing themes and a **`Global`** component for global styles.
   - Example:

```

import { Global, css, ThemeProvider } from "@emotion/react";
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

const globalStyles = css`
  body {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
`;

const Button = styled.button`
  background-color: ${({ theme }) => theme.primary};
  color: white;
  font-size: 16px;
`;

const theme = {
  primary: "blue",
};

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <Global styles={globalStyles} />
      <Button>Click me</Button>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

- Exercise: Create a styled React component using Emotion and implement theming.

1. Practical exercise: Create a simple React app with Styled-components and Emotion

   - Objective: Build a small React application that uses both Styled-components and Emotion to style its components.
   - Steps:
     1. Set up a new React project.
     2. Install and configure Styled-components and Emotion.
     3. Create a few styled components with each library.
     4. Implement theming and global styles for both libraries.
     5. Combine the styled components into a single user interface.

1. **Introduction to UI Libraries**
   ◦ Benefits of using UI libraries: UI libraries provide pre-built components and styling for faster development, consistent design, and improved user experience.
   ◦ Criteria for choosing a UI library: Consider factors such as project requirements, available components, customization options, performance, and community support.
1. **Material-UI**
   ◦ Overview: Material-UI is a popular React UI library that implements Google's Material Design guidelines.
