# React File Structure

When you create a new React app using **`create-react-app`**, several files and folders are generated by default. Here's an overview of each file and its purpose:

1. **`package.json`**: This file contains metadata about your project, including its name, version, dependencies, and scripts for running, building, and testing your app. It is used by the npm package manager.
2. **`package-lock.json`**: This file is automatically generated and keeps track of the exact versions of the installed dependencies for your project. This ensures that other developers working on the project get the same dependencies when they run **`npm install`**.
3. **`README.md`**: This file provides basic information about your project, how to set up the development environment, and how to run, build, and test your app. You can update this file to include more specific information about your project.
4. **`node_modules/`**: This folder contains the dependencies (libraries and packages) used by your project. It is created when you run **`npm install`**. You should not modify the contents of this folder directly.
5. **`public/`**: This folder contains public assets and files that are not processed by Webpack, the build tool used by **`create-react-app`**. These files are served directly by the web server.
   - **`index.html`**: This is the main HTML file of your app. It includes a root **`<div>`** element with the ID "root", where your React app will be rendered. You can also add additional metadata, links to external stylesheets, and other global assets in this file.
   - **`favicon.ico`**: This is the default favicon for your app. You can replace it with your own favicon.
   - **`manifest.json`**: This file provides metadata about your app, such as its name, icons, and display properties. It is used when your app is installed on a user's device as a Progressive Web App (PWA).
   - **`robots.txt`**: This file provides information to web crawlers about which parts of your website should or should not be crawled and indexed.
6. **`src/`**: This folder contains the main source code of your React app. You will primarily work in this folder when developing your app.
   - **`index.js`**: This is the entry point of your React app. It imports the **`App`** component and renders it inside the root **`<div>`** element in **`index.html`**.
   - **`App.js`**: This file defines the main **`App`** component, which is rendered by **`index.js`**. You can start building your app by modifying this component or adding new components to the **`src/`** folder.
   - **`App.css`**: This file contains the global styles for your app. You can modify these styles or add new stylesheets to style your components.
   - **`App.test.js`**: This file contains a simple test for the **`App`** component using the Jest testing library. You can add more tests to your app by creating new **`.test.js`** files.
   - **`index.css`**: This file contains global CSS styles that are applied to the entire app, such as the body and HTML elements. You can modify these styles or remove this file if you prefer to use a different styling approach.
   - **`logo.svg`**: This is the default React logo used in the initial **`App`** component. You can remove this file if you don't need it.
   - **`reportWebVitals.js`**: This file is used to collect and log performance metrics of your app in development mode. You can remove this file if you don't need performance tracking.
   - **`setupTests.js`**: This file is used to set up the testing environment for your app. You can add global configurations, import testing libraries, and define utility functions here.
