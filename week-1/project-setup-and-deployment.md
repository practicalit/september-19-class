## Project Setup and Deployment

Here are the steps to deploy a React application on Netlify and integrate it with Git for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD):

1. **Create a React application:** First, in your root directory create a new folder called `apps` (`mkdir apps`) and then `cd apps`. Inside your `apps` directroy, create a new React application using the **`npx create-react-app <name of your app>`** command.
2. **Create a Git repository:** Create a new Git repository on a Git hosting service of your choice, such as **[GitHub](https://github.com/)** or GitLab.
3. **Connect Netlify to your Git repository:** Log in to **[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)** and select "New site from Git" from the dashboard. Choose your Git provider and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.
4. **Select your repository and branch**: Once connected to your Git repository, select the repository you want to deploy and choose the branch you want to deploy.
5. **Configure your build settings:** Netlify will automatically detect your build settings based on your project's configuration files. If you need to customize your build settings, you can do so in the "Build & Deploy" section of the site settings.
6. **Set up continuous deployment**: In the "Build & Deploy" section, enable "Continuous Deployment" to automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to your Git repository.
7. **Test your deployment:** Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to your Git repository. Test your deployment by visiting the site's URL.
8. **Optional:** Set up custom domains and SSL: In the "Domain settings" section of the site settings, you can set up custom domains and SSL certificates to secure your site and make it accessible via your own domain name.
