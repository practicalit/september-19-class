### Course Overview:

In this comprehensive, project-based course, you will learn how to build a modern, full stack web application using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Throughout the course, you will gain practical experience by developing an Employee Management App, which will serve as a platform to apply the concepts and techniques you learn in each module. By the end of this course, you will have a strong understanding of full stack development, and you will be able to create, manage, and deploy web applications confidently.
